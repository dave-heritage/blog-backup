### What are Python Decorators?

Decorators are a tool used in Python(and many other languages) that can be used to modify the behavior of a function or class. Decorators are essentially functions that accept another function as an argument and then return a function that would modify the input function in some way.

  
Decorators can be used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, authentication, process time auditing etc. They are a powerful tool for developers use to create more concise, flexible code.

### Using Python Decorators:

  
Here is a basic example of a decorator in Python:

```python
def my_decorator(func):    
    def wrapper():        
        print("Before the function is called.")        
        func()        
        print("After the function is called.")    
        return wrapper


@my_decorator
def say_hello():    
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

In this example, the `my_decorator` function is defined to take another function `func` as an argument. It returns a new function `wrapper` that adds behavior before and after the input function is called.

  
The `@my_decorator` syntax above the `say_hello` function is called a decorator syntax. It applies the `my_decorator` to the `say_hello` function. The `say_hello` function is now modified to include the behavior defined in the decorator.

  
When the `say_hello` function is called, the output will be:

```python
Before the function is called.
Hello!
After the function is called.
```

  
This is just a simple example demonstrating how this works, but isn't something you would really use in your code. Let's look at a few examples that would be a bit more applicable to something you may see in the real world.

### Timing Decorator Example:

```python
import time


def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print("Elapsed time: {}".format(end_time - start_time))
        return result
    return wrapper


@timer
def my_func():
    time.sleep(2)


my_func() #Output: Elapsed time: 2.0000710487365723
```

This decorator would measure the time in which the method `my_func` took to execute. It uses the `time` module to calculate the elapsed time and displays it. This would be useful in the event you want to analyze your functions for time effeciency.

### Authentication Decorator Example:

```python
def requires_auth(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not authenticated:
            raise Exception("Authentication required!")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper


@requires_auth
def my_secret_function():
    print("This function is secret!")


authenticated = False
my_secret_function() # Output: Exception: Authentication required
authenticated = True
my_secret_function() # Output: This function is secret!
```

  
This decorator restricts access to a function unless the user is authenticated. It raises an exception if the user is not authenticated and returns the function's result if they are.

  
Decorators are a powerful tool that can be used to enhance the behavior or flexibility of Python projects. This is a basic overview of the paradigms of how they work and how they can be implemented. If you're interested in knowing more about them I recommend you check out a deeper dive!
